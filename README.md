# ownShell

ownShell is a personal project to help understand all the command line functions in their deep complexities, as well as help expand my C programming skills / knowledge.

My goal is to make a fully opensource and customizable terminal that has low overhead and can handle most requests like any other terminal could, along with even some custom fuctions / features.

To run, simply download the ownShell.exe file, and run.
To edit / inspect code, download the ownShell.c file, and to compile (I have been using gcc - as it is the base use in VScode), run this command in the terminal:
gcc ownShell.c -o ownShell.exe -mwindows -ldwmapi -luxtheme

Then run your new ownShell.exe file!

Thanks for reading :))
